# borg
borg is an inventory collection and dispersal system.

borg is a personal project designed to solve a niche problem of inventory management at scale.

Yes, there are many inventory management systems out there, but none that currently integrate the problems of "desired state" with "actual state" and integrate with things like a distributed document store as well as automation tooling, as well as the ability to poll for status from each machine.

This is all just a vague notion in my head right now, and will focus on very specific products initially, with generalization being the end goal.



# NB: This is a Work in Progress
